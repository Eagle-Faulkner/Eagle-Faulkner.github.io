SLEET is a program designed for Windows to help users have a more concise way of playing roms through their choice of emulators.  It provides users with the ability to either create a windows executable file that uses command line to point to their emulator and their rom so they can launch the game more easily, or the option to add the rom to their Steam library directly, pointing Steam to the emulator the user has chosen.
